            <p>
              These days is easy and almost normal to feel lost into some kind of
              void or loop that is difficult to break through despite the
              awareness of it. We know this! Yet we don’t apply that knowledge to
              the circumstances, to the life style and environment around us. We
              can see this in business, entrepreneurship, politics — Oh yes
              politics ha.. ha… ehm…in every area that has to do with a human
              being!
            </p>
            <p>
              Applied knowledge if that makes sense should be the focus of
              education these days. Just killing our memories with information
              that we might not use at all is not the ideal situation you would
              want to live in. Every one wants to be successful in business,
              entrepreneurship, life etc who doesn’t but then we do really need to
              ask ourselves with brutal honesty why is not working?
            </p>
            <p>
              It is an illusion! The problem lies on the brain’s ability to create
              a virtual reality that in reality doesn’t coincide with the real
              world or whatever path one is pursuing. The fact is that everyone
              knows things! Every one knows what is right or wrong! But we know it
              with our brains, inside our virtual reality. We lack the need to
              know it with our actions!
            </p>
            <p>
              We all have dreams and wants and plans and the list goes to
              infinity… still going. But the question that stays probably
              unanswered till you die is…. <b>why is this not working?</b> The
              only way to break through those self made unconscious realities or
              illusions is to take action. Hah! Action a word these days that
              almost makes you feel challenged just by seeing it written.
            </p>
            <h2>Feeling real vs real feelings</h2>
            <p>
              The reason is difficult to take actions is because of the fear we
              feel or the comfort we feel in our present circumstances. Another
              thing we need to realize is that feelings are just feelings!
              Feelings yes feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
              We humans live everyday every second in our life based on the way we
              feel about anything from our thoughts to relationships. Feelings are
              important since they work as fuel for the brain. They fuel the brain
              into creating realities about ourselves, daydreams, about the
              reality around us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh yeah It feels like this therefore must be true or right. However
              feeling something doesn’t make it true or right. Feelings are real
              but can those feelings be considered true? We see this with
              terrorists who kill others because they absolutely feel it is right
              and thus the only true way. But we know that people who are
              successful in life, business etc are those who own their feelings.
              It takes courage to doubt and ask the truth about one’s own feelings
              no matter how pleasant or how sad or real might those feelings feel.

            <h2>Define them or they will define your reality.</h2>
            <p>
              Surely feelings are strong and are meant to be so. I myself I think
              I might be able to just explain 30% of the feelings I feel on a
              daily basis and chances are that you too might be part of that
              majority. It takes a lot of courage, determination and wisdom to see
              clearly through all the feelings that cross our minds and hearts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another obstacle to overcome feelings and break through the self
              made reality is the lack of ability in understanding our feelings.
              You probably heard about EQ right?! People with high EQ are
              considered to be able to describe precisely how they feel. As a
              result people considered with high EQ are more likely to have
              control over the way they react in any given situation, be it job
              interview, decision making or common daily relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ability to describe properly to someone how you feel is
              essential in giving feedback and getting the right support and not
              feeling dumb even after talking to someone for a long time. One good
              practice that I personally am trying to keep as daily as possible is
              self checking at the end of the day. Usually I am in my bed just
              before sleeping. Replaying the whole day in my mind and analyze the
              feelings and things that I think could or did play an important role
              in the way that the events unfolded in my day.
            </p>
            <p>Why is this important?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First I don’t want to carry with me the feelings I have
                accumulated during the whole day in my sleep. Trust me it won’t be
                an easy sleep.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second it helps to feel new start at the time you wake up. Start
                your day feeling fresh rather than the same.
              </li>
              <li>
                Third you will notice that you will have more control next time
                you will face some similar situation. Oh yes you will!
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The strongest among them all</h2>
            <p>
              The spectrum of the feelings we have during a day, month and year is
              vast and almost out of control. But among the variety of feelings
              that we feel there is one that beats them all. That is <u>LOVE</u>.
              Stephen Covey said something wise in his book the 8 habit from
              effectiveness to greatness that love is not a feeling but an action.
              Yet the impact or feelings that derives from acting centered on love
              is enormous in for the whole being.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes love the strongest among all is it’s creative attribute.
              Love has the power to create — from creating your dreams, passions,
              self reality, family and the list goes on. But what also makes love
              dangerous is that it is almost impossible to break through it! Wait
              why would one need to break through it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Well because yes no matter how amazing love feels there is also
              false love! Wait I thought love is good and only good! The truth
              is…..It is not. Wow what are you saying? But love is the purpose of
              life! If i feel love in whatever I do that means it must be right!
              Well there is another reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Love has a direction. It can be self centered or selfish or it can
              be centered on for the sake of others. The point is we are
              constantly loving things just the difference is that we could be
              loving the wrong way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason we keep doing the same things even though we might know
              is wrong is because we love it. Love makes us attach strong to
              anything! Is that wrong? Not at all most of the times is
              advantageous. However what happens if we attach to the wrong thing?!
            </p>
            <p>
              That might be a big problem since is difficult to break through it.
              I love this…I love that… oh yes I want this but in reality I love it
              this way — is what we keep saying or at least feeling within most of
              the time without being aware.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love my business, idea, plan, and so on. Difficult to let it go!
              Love has a strong connection with the Self! When I love something I
              become one with it. It is Me. Difficult to let go of My feelings.
              One of the reasons why love is difficult to deal with is that with
              love comes pain. Wherever is pain there is love.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pain we feel in our body is the absence of loving our body
              properly, the pain we feel in our hearts is the lack of loving
              others properly. The pain of loneliness is the absence of being
              loved and loving others. Yet the pain we feel in our body during
              training is still yet the presence of loving our bodies properly.
              The pain a mother feels during birth is a result of love.
            </p>
            <p>They say no pain no gain!</p>
            <h2>Breaking Through</h2>
            <p>First of all the brutal truth:</p>
            <p><i>You can’t escape self made reality alone!</i></p>
            <p>
              Guess why? Because the source of the problem and solution is You.
              The main difficulty is to notice when you are being a problem or a
              solution. You can’t trust your self….. completely. That means I need
              a lot of self checks, that is your responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              But you need others just in case you might fool yourself. And yes
              you got precedents on that… remember? So you need others that help
              you jump out when you fall into self made illusions again. And yes
              you are going to fall back again for a while. Be sure to have proper
              people around.
            </p>
            <p>
              Successful entrepreneurs, business mans, professionals are not those
              that just know how to supervise and guide others. Most of them are
              able to do so because most of them have mastered the ability to
              check and supervise themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Breaking through the self made illusions in our brains is not easy
              and the reason why for most of us going the same way for a long time
              despite knowing it is not right.
            </p>
            <p>
              This mostly because it is very difficult to let feelings go. To not
              get attached to some wounds, fears, happiness or joy that might feel
              real but might not be the path right for us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actions are needed to bring us out of our self made realities and
              those actions are the ones that are not easy. The ones that bring us
              out of comfort zone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because those actions are in a way against yourself. Is a fight with
              myself and the most difficult person to fight is the self. Therefore
              one of the most important skills is self checking whether you are
              true to your principles!
